## Script Installation Method
Below we'll still go over our way of setting up a brand new validator with the automated installation scripts. We're assuming you have a server and a [regular user account](/admin#user-account) logged in already. Get to that point before proceeding:

### Install Docker
The official guide doesn't mention that you need to install Docker.

Taken from [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) here's our notes for installing docker on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04LTS once your server is online and logged in as the user `servicefindora` (update if you used a different account):

```text copy
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y && curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - && sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable" && sudo apt install docker-ce -y
```

Run the following. If your username is not `servicefindora` update the username below first:

```text copy
sudo usermod -aG docker servicefindora
```

### Verifiy Docker access
At this point you need to disconnect and reconnect so your user account gains access to the Docker daemon.

Once reconnected, type `groups` and you will see a list of your groups. If `docker` appears, you are ready to run the install script.

### Download Auto Installation Script
At this point you're ready to start the manual installation on docs.findora.org but if you want to make it easier to run and setup, run the following command to automate the rest of the installation at this point:  
<Tabs items={["mainnet", "testnet"]} defaultIndex="0">
  <Tab>
    ```text copy
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FindoraNetwork/findora-toolbox/main/src/bin/main/install_mainnet.sh -O node_init_mainnet.sh && bash -x node_init_mainnet.sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```text copy
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FindoraNetwork/findora-toolbox/main/src/bin/main/install_testnet.sh -O node_init_testnet.sh && bash -x node_init_testnet.sh
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The installer will pull the installation script and get everything setup. At the end of the installer you'll have a fully working validator syncing up to the blockchain on a brand new tmp.gen.keypair and priv_validator_key.json file. These are usable as wallets but are also disposable still at this point. You can test out all the functions of a Findora server now as long as you don't run the staking and creation commands.

## After Installation
> At this point you'll have a system that begins syncing automatically on the blockchain after the database download and unpacking completes. Wait for your `sync_status` to equal false before creating your validator or migrating to a new system.  

## After Installation
After you finish the installation script you still need to fund your wallet, stake your FRA and start your validator and backup your private key files. Head over to our [post install section](/findora/post) for those commands!
