# Toolbox Documents

Here's a deep dive into how the toolbox works currently. If you're looking for the installation instrctuions, those are [here](/findora/toolbox).

## Intro

The [Findora Validator Toolbox](https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/findora-toolbox) is designed to help Findora validators from start to finish - Installation to daily management operations. It has an Installer and Management Menu.

## Deep Dive video
We put together a video taking a deeper look into the validator toolbox.

## Installer

On first run, you will be asked if you'd like to install (fresh server) and then if you want a `mainnet` or `testnet` setup. On an existing server it will ask if this server runs `mainnet` or `testnet` (will work on auto detect soon!).

The installer will pull the installation script and get everything setup. At the end of the installer you'll have a fully working validator syncing up to the blockchain on a brand new tmp.gen.keypair and priv_validator_key.json file. These are usable as wallets but are also disposable still at this point. You can test out all the functions of a Findora server now as long as you don't run the staking and creation commands.

The Toolbox will also create the folder ~/findora_backup - Each time you launch it will recheck the files and notify you if it detects any issues.

You can do all the testing you'd like at this point and wipe the server with no harm. If you'd like to go live with these keys [here's the remaining things](/findora/post#create-staker_memo-file) that need to be performed after installation:

## Menu Options

We're still filling out the menu options, here's a current shot of the options as of 12/15/2022:

![Findora Toolbox Menu Options](/findora_menu_121522.png)
| Option | Function | Notes |
| :---- | :---: | :---- |
| 1 | Show 'curl' stats info | Shows output of `curl 'http://localhost:26657/status'`, most info will be moved to front page
| 2 | Show 'fn' stats info | Shows output of `fn show`, most info will be moved to front page
| 3 | Show Balance | Coming soon, will be moved to front page
| 8 | Update Findora Container | Pull latest version, re-create and restart local server container, you may miss blocks
| 9 | Run Safety Clean | Runs the safety_clean script, wipes database, preserves wallet info, full reset of system
| 10 | Update Operating System | Safely stops your container before running updates, you may miss blocks
| 13 | Show system disk info | Info about hard drive space!
| 14 | TMI about your Validator | A validator info dump, coming soon?
| 15 | TMI about your Server | All of the hardware information on your VPS
| 888 | Migrate to this Server | A hidden option, only enabled if you follow the [Moving Servers](/findora/moving) guide.
| 999 | Reboot Server | Safely stop your container & reboot your server. You will miss blocks with this option!

Please note, if you launch the toolbox after a reboot we will tell you if your container is down and help you get it back online with the update version script.

## Backup Key Files

Using the toolbox will copy all the files you need to backup into the folder `~/findora_backup` for safe keeping. Transfer this folder home using an sFTP program or command line utility.

Here's the list of files in `~/findora_backup` and where they reside while being used by the application:

```text copy
- tmp.gen.keypair - This file is the same as your network_node.key file (network being mainnet or testnet)
- config folder - This is a copy of your tendermint/config folder which contains priv_validator_key.json
```

## Future Updates

### Better stats

We will be pulling all stats to the front page. Unlike our other toolbox option 1 and 2 are still useful as we'll only be pulling the juicy bits to the front page. We'll leave options 1/2 as is mostly other that some formatting while moving the good stuff forward to always be available.

We will setup the toolbox to auto refresh like our other one does once we have stats pulled forward.

### Web frontend

We've got the framework for a web front end built and we will be working on using python/flask to run a local web server you can use to install/manage/migrate your findora validator, stay tuned!
