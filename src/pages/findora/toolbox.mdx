# Findora Toolbox Setup

This guide is for installing the Validator Toolbox and then a Findora Validator Node onto a brand new validator server. After you finish this guide you'll use our [Post Install](/findora/post) section to stake FRA and create your validator.

Here's a short video of us installing and using the toolbox!

## Existing Validators

Toolbox will install on existing validators as well. Since you already have a user account and docker, you're good to skip ahead and run the [install string](/findora/toolbox#run-installer) to setup the management menu. After that use the normal [launch command](/findora/toolbox#relaunch-toolbox) to check for updates and run the menu each time.

## Github Repository

The Findora Validator Toolbox repository has <Stars /> ðŸŒŸ on [GitHub](https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/findora-toolbox). If you enjoy our Validator Toolbox software can you head to our page and give us a ðŸŒŸ today? Thank you!

## Pre-Install Tasks

### Server Selection

Grab a server. We suggest using a budget host with enough storage. Currently used providers (depending on location) are ovh.com / ovh.us, server4u, contabo. [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=uUlKM6mNXPli) is no longer recommended for a host as crypto is against their policy but does work great for learning and testing a Findora server.

The Hardware Requirements:

- Recommended: 16GB RAM, 4 Core CPU, 300GB NVMe Hard Disk

## Server Prep

### Setup A User Account

See our admin tools page on setting up a [user account](/admin#user-account) & using [ssh keys](/admin#ssh-keys) for passwordless secure login.

Once you're logged into your user account, you're ready to move on.

### Firewall Ports

We covered setting up your firewall for [Findora right here](/findora/new#firewall). If you don't have a web firewall now is the time to configure UFW.

### Docker Installation

At this point you need to [install docker using these instructions](/admin#docker-installation) if you didn't already do so.

## Run Installer

Once you've logged back in and your user is in the docker group, run the folloing code to install the toolbox and begin installation on either `mainnet` or `testnet`. Our menu will launch and ask you a few simple questions to get you fully loaded and online:

<Tabs items={["mainnet", "testnet"]} defaultIndex="0">
  <Tab>
  ```text copy
  cd ~/ && sudo apt install python3-pip -y && git clone https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/findora-toolbox.git && cd findora-toolbox && pip3 install -r requirements.txt --quiet && cd ~/ && python3 ~/findora-toolbox/src/app.py --mainnet
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```text copy
  cd ~/ && sudo apt install python3-pip -y && git clone https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/findora-toolbox.git && cd findora-toolbox && pip3 install -r requirements.txt --quiet && cd ~/ && python3 ~/findora-toolbox/src/app.py --testnet
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The installer will pull the installation script and get everything setup. At the end of the installer you'll have a fully working validator syncing up to the blockchain on a brand new tmp.gen.keypair and priv_validator_key.json file. These are usable as wallets but are also disposable still at this point. You can test out all the functions of a Findora server now as long as you don't run the staking and creation commands.

## After Installation

> At this point you'll have a system that begins syncing automatically on the blockchain after the database download and unpacking completes. Wait for your `sync_status` to equal false before creating your validator or migrating to a new system.

## Relaunch Toolbox

To re-start the toolbox with updates, run the following code:

```text copy
cd ~/findora-toolbox/ && git pull && pip3 install -r requirements.txt --quiet && cd ~/ && python3 ~/findora-toolbox/src/app.py
```

## Post Installation

If you're just installing your validator for the first time you still need to fund your wallet, stake your FRA, start your validator and backup your private key files. Head over to our [post install section](/findora/post) for those commands!

## Toolbox Pro Tips

If you're an experienced Validator you can find more info on what the toolbox is doing for you [right here](/findora/docs).
