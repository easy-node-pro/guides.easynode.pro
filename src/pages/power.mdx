# Power Users

## cloud-init
If you know if your server provider has cloud init, you're a power user. A few hosts that have cloud-init include OVH, Hetzner, Digital Ocean, Vultr and many many more.

Here's our custom cloud-init that will prep any VPS for either the Harmony or Findora (or both) Validator Toolboxes!  

This cloud init installs all pre-requirements for both chains before you even start using your new server. To use the code below simply replace the ssh-rsa key with your id_rsa.pub key and set the username you would like to use on the server (currently `serviceuser` in 4 spots this example, change it if you'd like to customize).

```text copy
#cloud-config
users:
  - name: servicefindora
    groups: sudo
    shell: /bin/bash
    sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
    ssh-authorized-keys:
      - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc_YOUR_PUB_KEY_HERE_i7WjTlcTKjUkFMDDcfi5Q==
package_upgrade: true
runcmd:
  - apt-get update
  - apt-get upgrade -y
  - curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
  - add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
  - apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common docker-ce docker-ce-cli docker-compose containerd.io bind9-dnsutils git python3-pip python3-dotenv unzip -y
  - systemctl start docker
  - systemctl enable docker
  - usermod -aG docker servicefindora
  ```

**Note**: The cloud-init does take a few minutes to run after your server comes online. Wait a few minutes for this to complete or verifiy it finishes up by watching the logs with `sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog` to see it complete.  

## Findora
If you're going to be installing Findora you will need to exit your session and start a new one to join the Docker group. Run the command `groups` to verify your account has docker listed as a group.

Pull the runner to your servery by running the following command to also start the installer:
```text copy
cd ~/ && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FindoraNetwork/findora-toolbox/main/src/bin/findora.sh && chmod +x findora.sh && ./findora.sh --installer
```

The installer will start up and ask if you'd like mainnet or testnet and begin installation. To re-launch the menu with the latest updates after installation completes, run:
```text copy
./findora.sh
```

Show all options with:
```text copy
./findora.sh --help
```

```text copy
cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/easy-node-pro/harmony-toolbox.git ~/harmony-toolbox && cd harmony-toolbox && pip3 install -r requirements.txt && python3 ~/harmony-toolbox/src/install.py
